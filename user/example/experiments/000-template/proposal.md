# Proposal: Template Experiment

**Status**: proposed
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Author**: [your name]

## Hypothesis

[What we believe to be true and want to test. Be specific and falsifiable.]

Example: "Fine-tuning a pretrained model on our domain-specific data will improve F1 score by at least 5% compared to the baseline."

## Background

[Why this matters. What concept or observation led to this experiment?]

## Method

### Approach

[High-level description of what we're going to do.]

### Setup

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Data | [datasets, splits, preprocessing] |
| Compute | [GPU, memory, time estimate] |
| Dependencies | [libraries, pretrained models] |
| Code | [relevant files or branches] |

### Procedure

1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
3. [Step 3]

### Variables

- **Independent**: [what we're changing]
- **Dependent**: [what we're measuring]
- **Controlled**: [what we're holding constant]

## Evaluation

### Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [metric 1] | [what it measures] |

### Baseline

[What we're comparing against.]

### Success Criteria

- **Confirm if**: [specific threshold or observation]
- **Reject if**: [specific threshold or observation]

## Limitations

- [Assumption or constraint]
